# mobile-vs-web-ecommerce
This project was completed as a contract data analysis task for a New York City-based fashion ecommerce company. The company offers both an online shopping platform (website and mobile app) and in-store personal stylist sessions. Their goal is to determine which digital platform (mobile app or website) should be prioritized based on customer behavior and purchase patterns.

Using linear regression, we analyzed key usage and performance metrics to provide data-driven recommendations.
